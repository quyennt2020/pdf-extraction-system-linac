Chapter 4: Multi-Leaf Collimator (MLC) System

4.1 System Overview

The Multi-Leaf Collimator (MLC) system consists of 120 tungsten leaves arranged in two banks of 60 leaves each. The system provides precise beam shaping capabilities for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT).

Key Components:
- MLC Controller Unit (Part Number: MLC-CTRL-2000)
- Leaf Drive Motors (Part Number: LDM-001-V3) - 120 units
- Position Encoders (Part Number: ENC-HD-500) - 120 units
- Motor Driver Cards (Part Number: MDC-24V-100) - 10 units
- Safety Interlock System (Part Number: SIS-MLC-200)

4.2 Error Codes and Troubleshooting

Error Code: 7002
Message: LEAF MOVEMENT ERROR
Description: The actual direction of movement of a leaf does not match the expected direction, or a leaf has moved that should be stationary.
Possible Causes:
- Faulty leaf drive motor
- Damaged position encoder
- Loose motor connections
- Motor driver card failure
Response: Check drive connections to leaf motors and verify free movement of leaves.

Error Code: 7003  
Message: LEAF POSITION TIMEOUT
Description: A leaf has not reached its commanded position within the specified time limit.
Possible Causes:
- Mechanical obstruction
- Motor power supply failure
- Encoder calibration error
Response: Inspect leaf bank for obstructions and verify motor power supply voltages.

Error Code: 7004
Message: MLC INTERLOCK FAILURE
Description: Safety interlock system has detected an unsafe condition.
Possible Causes:
- Door position sensor failure
- Emergency stop activation
- Interlock circuit malfunction
Response: Check all safety interlocks and door positions before resetting.

4.3 Maintenance Procedures

4.3.1 Daily Checks
- Verify leaf position accuracy using QA phantom
- Check motor temperatures (should be < 45Â°C)
- Inspect leaf surfaces for damage

4.3.2 Weekly Maintenance
- Lubricate leaf guide rails (Use lubricant: LUB-MLC-001)
- Check motor mounting bolts (Torque: 8.5 Nm)
- Verify encoder calibration

4.3.3 Monthly Maintenance
- Replace air filters (Part Number: FILT-AIR-MLC)
- Check cooling system operation
- Perform comprehensive position accuracy test

5.2 Error Codes

Error Code: 8001
Message: GANTRY POSITION ERROR
Description: Gantry position feedback does not match commanded position.
Response: Check encoder connections and recalibrate if necessary.

Error Code: 8002
Message: GANTRY OVERSPEED
Description: Gantry rotation speed exceeds safety limits.
Response: Check motor controller parameters and brake system operation.
